# Bank Practice Tech Test in Ruby

Requirements
-----
* You should be able to interact with the your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

Acceptance Criteria
-----
Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012 And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012 And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012 When she prints her bank statement Then she would see:

```
date       || credit || debit   || balance
14/01/2012 ||        || 500.00  || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00||         || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00||         || 1000.00

User Stories
-----
```
As a user,
I would like to make a deposit,
So that I can add income to my account.

As a user,
I would like to make a withdrawal,
So that I can spend my hard earned money.

As a user,
I would like to see my account's statement,
So that I can see the balance of my account.

As a bank,
I would like to stop customers having a negative balance,
So we always don't accidentally give a customer a credit line.
